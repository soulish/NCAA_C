This is my NCAA basketball analysis code.  It was originally written in
Ruby.  I am planning on converting it into C++, while retaining all of its
functionality.  Since I use ROOT to do a lot of plotting and fitting of
the data, I may retain some Ruby code to make fast plots without having
to write to file.  But otherwise, all of the code will be written in C++.
